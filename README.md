Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on building a robust sentiment analysis model to classify social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral. The study employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and emoji/hashtag handling to preprocess raw text. Traditional machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression with TF-IDF features) are compared against deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTMs, BERT) to evaluate performance on noisy, real-world text data. Key challenges include handling sarcasm, slang, and context-dependent sentiments.
